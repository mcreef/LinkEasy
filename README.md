# ðŸ”— LinkEasy

LinkEasy is a minimalistic self-hosted "Linktree" or "LinkedIn Bio" alternative. This fork removes the Google Analytics tracking and replaces the Gravatar integation with a local img source, thus removing the need for PHP [1]

A working example of the original PHP version can be found [here](https://mcreef.de/).

[1] there is still a tiny PHP page used for obfuscating the email address from bots. When I get to finding a good HTML/CSS alternative, I will remove it.
